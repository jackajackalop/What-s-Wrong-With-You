# What's Wrong With You

So my program is very heavily based on a interactive flowchart-esque game thing I really like (http://youfeellikeshit.com/). It’s been helpful, but recently I’ve found I’m often very much not in the mood for people treating me excessive gentleness and softness, so I wanted to make something like it, but with a rude, swearing parrot counselor that uses text speak and internet lingo.

It's very much tailored for me and my sense of humor but feel free to use it if it would help.
